			<p>However, as we engage deeper into any circumstance, at some point we will pass a <em>Point of no Return</em> and from that point on our inferences are no longer really influencing the action of the moment – it would be more accurate to say that it is our actions alone that are eliciting responses. Up until that point the opportunity to revise our inferences and thus our actions was present – now, the option of revisability is no longer available to us.

			<p>At the Center we believe that with a greater awareness and appreciation for both Sympathetic Intelligence, and Revisable Inference and the relationship between them, individuals may be able to influence and control how that critical Point of No Return develops, in a way that reduces the number of incidences where outcomes are either undesirable, or worse result in either injury or loss of life, that with the benefit of hindsight should have resulted in neither.
