			<h2 class="mt-3 mb-3">Reflective Spontaneity</h2>
			<p>As a result their spontaneous, sympathetic contribution to any moment, reflects both that contemplation and their appreciation of it. The term <em>'reflective'</em> also comes from the fact that their spontaneity is also a reflection of the actions by others in that same moment.

			<p>This aspect is unique to the theory of Sympathetic Intelligence because one element of it is focused exclusively on the 1st Tier,  i.e. the Individual or Intrapersonal Tier. The idea is that we train officers so that they can more safely conduct themselves spontaneously and naturally because their behavior is reflective rather than reactive. By ‘reflective’ we mean that their conduct appropriately reflects the demands of the circumstance, the best application of all their training and applicable protocol and finally that it reflects a heightened command and application of Sympathetic Intelligence. In making this distinction we also hold that reflective spontaneity is behavior that is based on a balanced integration of the three primary components of our intelligence - Intuition, Cognition and Emotion, and reflects the unique demands of each circumstance. In the result, officers are ‘plugged in’, on the same wavelength and most importantly, acting in sympathy with the demands of each moment.

			<p>The second element of this component of the training is that Police officers don’t have to just think in the moment, they have to act in the moment. It is this fact alone that presents the greatest challenge for police officers. it’s true we can’t stop time. However, we can prepare for the eventuality that in any one moment, we might wish we could. Developing Depthfulness (discussed below), and having a grasp of the presence of Sympathetic Intelligence at one and the same time, may be one way of preparing for that eventuality that may put time on the side of the police officer. So, in addition to the ‘reflective’ element here, we also see a three point tactical insertion into any one moment, that won’t stop time, but it may  give the police officer a tactical time advantage. These three levels are infinitely close to each other - it takes a fine eye to delineate the subtle difference between them, but here they are articulated in line with the origins of the concept - from the point of view of a rock drummer.

			<p>– One; Our Sympathetic Intelligence means that we are attached naturally to the moment, and our movements are fluid. Because We are ‘in step’, this means we are a part of or ‘at’ the moment, which is better than being behind it. We won’t need to ‘catch up’ at any point. By developing a natural ability to trust and deploy our Sympathetic Intelligence we achieve this, the first step. The first skill that a drummer needs is the ability to be in time.

			<p>– Two; Because of our grasp of Sympathetic Intelligence, and because we are connected sympathetically, we can more likely and more accurately sense what is about to happen, which is a lot better than being exposed to all of the possibilities that might happen. - We are locked into the moment and the sequence of the moment. The next moment will be a moment that will similarly be in sequence and this means that the foot we put forward at two is almost on the ground of the moment that is coming. The drummer is not just a time-keeper, the second skill of a drummer is to  establish time. They are locked into their fellow musicians. They are connected to them, and actually establish the means by which their fellow musicians are locked into each other. But, in a sense the other musicians are following the drummer, and the drummer is leading - the drummer is in charge of timing and they are the timemaster.

			<p>– Three; Because we have been trained in Sympathetic Intelligence, we have Depthfulness (discussed below), we are able to feel the context and because we are able to feel the context and align what is occurring with all of our experience, training, intuition, cognition, and emotions we are now better prepared for what is coming at us, and although we may not be in front of time, in a sense we have taken a step in that direction. We are focused and can narrow the options to better anticipate what might come. Now, we are not at, or even in the moment we are now looking at the context from the outside in, as opposed to the inside out, we have effectively placed ourselves, or a part of ourselves out of ourselves. We don’t have a crystal ball, but time is on our side, we have made time our friend. After keeping and establishing time, the next primary function of the drummer is to punctuate and create anticipation. They can push the song using subtle accenting techniques - in other words, they are ahead of the other musicians.

			<p>You can’t create time, but you can control how it unfolds to a very significant degree. You can’t create time, but just like the drummer you can speed it up or slow it down. You don’t have to be a drummer to understand how the context shapes the role of a drummer. In life, no-one is assigned the task of time master, but anyone can assume the position and the context will provide guidance for whoever does. We can’t create time, but we can make time for others and for the things we care about. We can’t create time, but we can make better use of it. 

			<p>The combination of these two elements - Balanced Integration and the Tactical Insertion of time management in the moment, means that the officers’ spontaneous reactions reflect the demands of the moment, they are appropriate to what is called for in the moment, and they are not driven by bias or disproportionate emotional behavior.
