				Imagine - Itâ€™s easy if you try!
				</p>
				<p>
				Here at the Center for Sympathetic Intelligence we believe we are forging a way forward to a better future, for what the world needs now is a more caring society.
				</p>
				<p>
				We also believe that the human race is an intelligent species that has so far failed to realize the full potential of its deepest intelligence - the capacity to live in sympathy with each other. 
				</p>
				<p>
				But here at the Center for Sympathetic Intelligence we imagine:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A Society where neighborliness is the norm rather than the exception!</li>
					<li><li>A workplace where people can earn a wage without suffering an environment filled with aggression, angst and stress!</li>
					<li>A Health Care Industry that really cares or a corporate financial world motivated in equal part between profit and socially responsible investing!</li>
					<li>A police force that rarely needs to exercise authority by force in conducting their day-to-day mission of keeping the peace or a police force that can rely on the force of reason and civility alone to ensure compliance.</li>
					<li>A higher educational system which really puts the student as a developing human person at the center of its mission and is also a great place for  teachers, instructors and professors alike to work.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
